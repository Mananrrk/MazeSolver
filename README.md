# 🧩 Maze Solver

A simple interactive Maze Solver web app that lets users create a maze, set start and end points, draw walls, and visualize the pathfinding process using either **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://mananrrk.github.io/MazeSolver/](https://mananrrk.github.io/MazeSolver/)

## ✨ Features

- Interactive grid-based maze creation  
- Set **Start** and **End** points  
- Draw and remove walls to create obstacles  
- Choose between BFS and DFS algorithms to solve the maze  
- Animated visualization of the pathfinding process  
- Reset functionality to clear the maze and start over

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Click **Set Start** and click a cell to set the starting point.  
2. Click **Set End** and click a cell to set the ending point.  
3. Click **Draw Walls** and click cells to toggle walls (obstacles).  
4. Select the algorithm (BFS or DFS) from the dropdown.  
5. Click **Solve Maze** to see the algorithm visualize the pathfinding.  
6. Click **Reset** to clear the maze and start fresh.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (external stylesheet)  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  

---

## 📁 Code Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure and UI elements  
- `styles.css`: External stylesheet for styling the grid and controls  
- `script.js`: Contains all JavaScript logic including grid creation, event handling, and pathfinding algorithms

## 📌 Algorithm Explanation

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):**  
  Finds the shortest path in terms of steps, guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid.  

- **DFS (Depth-First Search):**  
  Explores as far as possible down each branch before backtracking; may not find the shortest path but can be faster in some cases.
